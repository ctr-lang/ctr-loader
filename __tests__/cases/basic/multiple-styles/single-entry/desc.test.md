__Description__: Process multiple styles with a single require entry point

__Notes__

+ This method should be perfferd over the multiple-entry method demoed in `/multiple-entry`
+ You should avoid using `require` in `ctr` styles, however for testing purposes I use `require` in `/basic` and `requireWatch`, what you should use, in `/watch`
