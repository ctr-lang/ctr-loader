__Description__: Imports a yaml file, it's processed as a classes specified per `addClass: true` in the `yaml` method. Then creates styles from said classes.

__Notes__

+ You should avoid using `require` in `ctr` styles, however for testing purposes I use `require` in `/basic` and `requireWatch`, what you should use, in `/watch`
