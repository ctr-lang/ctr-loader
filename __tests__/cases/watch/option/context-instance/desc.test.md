__Description__: Should be able to pass an option Object as the last `ctr` instance argument to set/change the `context` of the watch directory

__Notes__

+ This test differs from `/context-loader` in that the `context` option is being set via the `ctr` instance, and the other test the `context` is set via the loader itself
