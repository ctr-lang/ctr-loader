__Description__: Should be able to pass an option Object to the `ctr-loader` to set/change the `context` of the watch directory

__Notes__

+ This test differs from `/context-instance` in that the `context` option is being set via the `ctr-loader`, and the other test the `context` is set via the `ctr` instance
