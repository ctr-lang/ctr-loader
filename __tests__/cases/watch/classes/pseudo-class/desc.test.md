__Description__: This is not a `ctr` class but it's structured like one, so its like a pseudo class which mimics the same actions as classes. This just demonstrates you don't have to use the confines of `ctr` classes and can roll out your own solution.

__Notes__

+ Take note that `require` caches the files so you have to orginize your pseudo classes in a way so that changed originate from the `.ctr.js`, or just don't set shit up like this, this test is sorta silly to start with
